# Sea of Simulation

## Chapters

### The Grid and the Physics of Data

**The Grid**
* The grid is a three-dimensional discrete space populated by data and programs.
* Every point in space contains one data unit and may be populated by at most one program.

**Data Waves**
* Data drifts across the sea of simulation, riding the data waves.
* Programs are placed at fixed points in the grid and observe the data waves.

**Taste for Data**
* A program sees the data in its immediate surrounding.
* Programs have a taste for certain kinds of data patterns to use as their inputs.
* Upon seeing such data, a computation is performed and its result is written back to the grid.

### Birth and Death of Programs

### Evolution of Programs

## Development
